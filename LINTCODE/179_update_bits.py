# 179. Update Bits 
# Given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e g , M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j)
# 
#  Notice
# In the function, the numbers N and M will given in decimal, you should also return a decimal number.
# 
# Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
# Clarification
# You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M=10011ï¼Œ you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j=3 and i=2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
# 
# Example
# Given N=(10000000000)2, M=(10101)2, i=2, j=6
# 
# return N=(10001010100)2
# 
# Challenge 
# Minimum number of operations?
