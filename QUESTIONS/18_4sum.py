# Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c, and d in S such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.
# 
# Note:
# Elements in a quadruplet (a,b,c,d) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d)
# The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.
#     For example, given array S = {1 0 -1 0 -2 2}, and target = 0.
# 
#     A solution set is:
#     (-1,  0, 0, 1)
#     (-2, -1, 1, 2)
#     (-2,  0, 0, 2)
