What happens when...
====================

This repository is an attempt to answer the age old interview question "What
happens when you type google.com into your browser's address box and press
enter?"

Except instead of the usual story, we're going to try to answer this question
in as much detail as possible. No skipping out on anything.

This is a collaborative process, so dig in and try to help out! There's tons of
details missing, just waiting for you to add them! So send us a pull request,
please!
