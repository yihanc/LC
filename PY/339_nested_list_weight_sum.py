# [55] 339    Nested List Weight Sum¶
# 
# 55.3%   Easy
# Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.
# 
# Each element is either an integer, or a list – whose elements may also be integers or other lists.
# 
# Example 1:
# Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]], return 10. (four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1)
# 
# Example 2:
# Given the list [1,[4,[6]]], return 27. (one 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3; 1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27)
# [56] 340    Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters¶
# 
# Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.
# 
# Example
# For example, Given s = "eceba", k = 3,
# 
# T is "eceb" which its length is 4.
# Challenge: O(n), n is the size of the string s.
